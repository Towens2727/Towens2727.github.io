### The Best Fantasy Novel You Haven't Read

**The Name of the Wind** by **Patrick Rothfuss** is a fantastic read. It's the top fantasy book on Good Reads that isn't a part of the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Game of Thrones series.

### Maggie Haberman's Twitter

I obsess over the daily ebb and flow of political theater, including election polling, special counsel investigations, and impeachment (okay, mostly impeachment). I stay up to date by following **New York Times correspondent Maggie Haberman**. Nothing gets past Maggie Haberman.

### Being a Board Game Snob 101

While I grew on Monopoly, Stratego, and Risk, the board games that capture my interest now look a lot different. I do a lot of my research on **Board Game Geek**, an online forum for discussing and ranking board games of the new, old, and ancient varities. For what it's worth, Chess stands at #439 in the overall rankings and Go comes in at #154. But I guess people seem to like them. If you're looking for a new game to play with friends, Board Game Geek is a fantastic resource.

### Being a Music Snob 101

Most of my opinions on music are stolen and rehashed from **Pitchfork** album reviews. Jokes aside, I get introduced to a lot of music here that I wouldn't otherwise have discovered.

### Where to Hike in Yosemite

I grew up visiting national parks with my family and am currently trying to explore every inch of **Yosemite National Park**. All Trails has incredible trail data coverage across the U.S. if you're ever trying to plan a hike.

### Nina Williams Climbing

What would it feel like to be 40 feet up a massive boulder in Bishop, CA, without a rope? I never plan on finding out, but I do enjoy seeing climber Nina Williams move confidently up one of the most ridiculous routes in the state.
